         <h3>1) What is <b>resistance</b> ?</h3>
         <p><b>Resistance</b> is that property of a conductor which tends to hold or restrict the flow of an electric current, it is encountered in every circuit.
            <br>
            The <b>ratio of the potential difference (V) across a conductor to the current (I)</b> through it is a constant. The constant is called resistance (R) of the conductor - Ohm's law.
            <br>
            Mathematically, <b>R = (V/I)</b>.
            <br>
            The <b>unit of resistance is ohm</b>.
            <br>
            A resistor offers resistance to current flow through it equally in both the directions. Resistance can be described as the property of the circuit element that offers opposition to the flow of current. As a result of this opposition that a resistor converts electrical energy to heat energy which is dissipated from its surface.
            <br>
            Since current is the flow of charges, Resistance is the opposition offered by a material to the flow of charges.
            <br>
           <b> Factors affecting</b> the resistance of a conductor :-
            <br>
            Length,
            Cross sectional area,
            Temperature and
            Type pf material.
            <br>
            1- <b>Length</b> :-
            
            The resistance R is proportional to the length of the conductor l. The longer a metal conductor, the greater will be its resistance.
            <br>
            2 - <b>Cross-sectional area</b> :-
            
            The resistance R of a material is inversely proportional to the cross sectional area A. Thick wire has less resistance than thin wire.
            
            R = p(l/A)
            l = length in meter
            A = area of cross section in squar meter
            p = resistivity in ohm meter
            R =resistance in ohm
            <br>
            3 - <b>Temperature </b>:-
            
            As the temperature increases, the resistance of most metals increases in proportion. On the other hand, non-metals such as gases decreases in resistance with increasing temperature.
            <br>
            4 - <b>Type of material</b> :-
            
            The resistance of a material is affected by how tightly the electrons are bound. For a metal, the tightness with which the electrons are held to the ions in the crystal lattice and the number of elecrons available for conduction affects the resistance. This varies from metal to metal.
            
            Gold is the best conductor and is expensive . Copper is almost as good a conductor as gold and is relatively cheap.
            Glass, plastic, paper, all have high resistance.
            Semiconductors (like silicon and germanium) have resistance intermediate between conducors and non-conductors.</p>
            <h3>2) <b>Classification</b> of resistor.</h3>
          <p>Resistors are passive electronic component used to limit amount of current through the circuit.
            <br>
            Depending upoun value of resistance, it can be classified into two ways:
            <br>
          <b> Fixed value </b> resistors,
           <b>Variable value </b> resistors <br><b>Fixed resistors</b> are further classified into:
           <br> a) Carbon composition type resistors <br> b) Metal Film type resistors <br> c) Wire wound type resistors <br><b>Variable resistors</b> are further classified into:
           <br> a) General purpose type resistors <br> b) Precision type resistors</p>
           <h3>3) <b>Type</b> of Resistors.</h3>
           <h3><b>Fixed</b></h3>
           <p>The fixed resistor will have only one value and will never change (other than through temperature, age, etc..)
              Examples are carbon composition resistors, wire wound resistors, thin film resistors, thick film resistors. <br>
              a) <b>Carbon composition </b> type resistors: <br>
              This is the most common type of low wattage resistor. <br>
              The resistive material is of carbon-clay composition and the leads are made of tinned copper. <br>
              These resistors are cheap and reliable and stability is high. <br>
              b) <b>Wire wound</b> resistors: <br>
              These resistors are a length of wire wound an insulating cylindrical core. <br>
              Usually wires of material such as constantan (60% copper and 40% nickel) and manganin which have high resistivities 
              and low temperature coefficients are employed. The complete wire wound resistor 
              is coated with an insulating material such as baked enamel. <br>
              c) <b>Metal film</b> resistors <br>
              It is constructed using film deposition techniques of depositing a thick film of resistive material onto an insulating substrate. <br>
              Only approximate values of resistance can be had by this method.</p>
              <h3><b>Variable</b></h3>
              <p>A resistor of which the ohmic resistance value can be adjusted. Either mechanically (potentiometer, rheostat) or electronically (digital potentiometer).
                <br>A variable resistor is a resistor of which the electric resistance value can be adjusted. <br> a) <b>Potentiometer :</b>  <br> The potentiometer is the most common variable resistor. It functions as a potential divider and is used to generate a voltage signal depending on the position of the potentiometer. This signal can be used for a very wide variety of applications including: Amplifier gain control(audio volume), measurement of distance or angles, tuning of circuits and much more. When variable resistors are used to tune or calibrate a circuit or application, trimmer potentiometers or trimpots are used, this are mostly small potentiometers mounted on the circuit board, which can be adjusted using a screwdriver. <br>
                b) <b>Rheostat</b> <br> Rheostats are very similar in construction to potentiometers, but are not used as a potential divider, but as a variable resistance. They use only 2 terminals instead of the 3 terminals potentiometers use. One connection is made at one end of the resistive element, the other at the wiper of the variable resistor. In the past rheostats were  used as power control devices in series with the load, such as a light bulb. Nowadays rheostats are not used as power control anymore as this is an inefficient method.  For power control, rheostats are replaced by more efficient switching electronics. Preset variable resistors, wired as rheostats are used in circuits to perform tuning or calibration. <br>
                c) <b>Digital resistor</b> <br>A digital variable resistor is a type of variable resistor where the change of resistance is not performed by mechanical movement but by electronic signals. They can change resistance in discrete steps and are often controlled by digital protocols such as I2C or by simple up/down signals.
