        <h1> Diode </h1>
        <h1><span> Introduction</span></h1>
        <p>A diode is a dispositive made of a semiconductor material, which has two terminals or electrodes (di-ode), that act like an on-off switch. When the diode is “on”, it acts as a short circuit
            and passes all current. When it is “off”, it behaves like an open circuit and passes no current.
            The two terminals are different and are marked as plus and minus in figure 1. If the polarity
            of the applied voltage matches that of the diode (forward bias), then the diode turns “on”.
            When the applied voltage polarity is opposite (reverse bias), it turns “off”. Of course this is
            the theoretical behaviour of an ideal diode, but it can be seen as a good approximation for a
            real diode. <br>A diode is simply a pn junction (see ’Introduction into Semiconductor Physics’) with the
            following characteristics: <br>
           <b> • Under forward bias, it needs a small voltage to conduct. This voltage drop is maintained
            during conduction. </b><br>
          <b>  • The maximum forward current is limited by heat-dissipation ability of the diode. Usually
            it is around 1000 mA.</b> <br>
           <b> • There is a small reverse current.</b> <br>

         <h3><b> Types of </b>diodes</h3> 
         <p>We can distinguish the following types of diodes:
          • Rectifier diodes are typically used for power supply applications. Within the power
          supply, you will see diodes as elements that convert AC power to DC power; <br>
          • Switching diodes have lower power ratings than rectifier diodes, but can function better
          in high frequency application and in clipping and clamping operations that deal with
          short-duration pulse waveforms; <br>
          Zener diodes, a special kind of diode that can recover from breakdown caused when
the reverse-bias voltage exceeds the diode breakdown voltage. These diodes are
commonly used as voltage-level regulators and protectors against high voltage surges; <br>
• Optical diodes; <br>
• Special diodes, such as varactors (diodes with variable capacity), tunnel diodes or
Schottky diodes. <br>


        </p>
        <h3><b>Zener </b>Diode</h3>
        <p>A conventional solid-state diode will not let current flow up to its breakdown voltage if reversebiased. By exceeding the breakdown voltage, a conventional diode is destroyed during
          breakdown due to excess current and overheating. In case of forward-bias (in the direction
          of the arrow), the diode exhibits a voltage drop of roughly 0.7 V. The voltage drop depends
          on the type of the diode. <br>A Zener diode exhibits almost the same properties, except the device is especially designed so as to have a greatly reduced breakdown voltage, the so-called Zener voltage. A
          Zener diode contains a heavily doped pn junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material. A reversebiased Zener diode will exhibit a controlled breakdown and let the current flow to keep the
          voltage across the Zener diode at the Zener voltage. For example, a 3.2 V Zener diode will
          exhibit a voltage drop of 3.2 V if reverse biased. However, the current is not unlimited, so
          the Zener diode is typically used to generate a reference voltage for an amplifier stage. The
          breakdown voltage can be controlled quite accurately in the doping process. Tolerances up
          to 0.05% are achievable, though the most widely used tolerances are 5% and 10%. The ef fect was discovered by the American physicist Clarence Melvin Zener. In figure 9, the Zener
          behaviour is illustrated:</p>
